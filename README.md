# Simple Seventeen

Simple Seventeen is a puzzle game where you combine tiles in an attempt to clear the board and complete the round. This is a simplified web version of my game Seventeen which is currently available for free on Android devices from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redmoshgames.seventeen).

This is a work in progress. Feel free to dive in and see how it all works!
